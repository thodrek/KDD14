Naming Conventions in the data at each part of the model:

newestimatedword.pkl : word distribution given a particular topic
newestimatedlocation.pkl: topic distribution given a location
newestimatedtime.pkl: time distribution given a topic
pred_model_source.py: python code which computes the topic cosine similarity for source-based model.
pred_model_loc.py: python code which computes the topic cosine similarity for location-based model.
topsourceloctimedict : this data contains all the cosine similarity values corresponding to each topic, source, location and time.
toploctimedict: this date contains all the cosine similarity values corresponding to topic, location and time.
totaldictionary.pkl: this data is a dictionary which represents the tensor and each key is represented as (word, location, source, time) and the value of a key is the absolute 
count of the word appearing at that location, source and time.

totalword.pkl: represents total number of unique words.
totallocation.pkl: represents total number of unique locations.
totalsource.pkl: represents total number of unique sources.
